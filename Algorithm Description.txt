The algorithm I used was a pipe and filter algorithm. Every channel used is as a pipe. All inputs come from a pipe outputs and all outputs of a gate or utility is an input to a channel. For the 4-bit adder I have 61 channels created that communicate with each of the processes. Since a different channel is used for every interaction with another process, the propagation will only move to the intended channels. If pulses occur simultaneously, it would not matter because each channel is uniquely associated with it's specific processes.
